# oldpcsetup
Oldpcsetup for reviving atique computers, targeting 256 MB RAM.

An old computer can be kept running if it's case design is beautiful,can communicate with importasnt old hardware or for demonstrations in museums. I use them to test what in GNU/Linux is V E R Y optimnised - good to keep an eye on when making slim virtual machines - a virtual machine does not run into the problems an old computer gives (like hdd thrashing).

They are very bad at memory swap usage (high head latency, a speed of 100 kB/s even on very new drives) - use bigger RAM or experiment with network swap drive (achieves 30 MB/s on 100 MB LAN but needs a host for the swap drive - maybe a Raspberry Pi 2).

They also need N E W power supplies as the 10 or more year old used ones are sensible (instability, can fry other devices on USB, make optical drives destroy CD/DVD because of power inconsistencies).

An optical drive needs opening and cleaning of mechanical sensors of door closed and cd put on engine (they are near the door engine) and a change of belt for door engine (sometimes I just put a little larger diameter belt wheel from a cassete recorder).
